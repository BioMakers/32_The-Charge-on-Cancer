# 32_The-Charge-on-Cancer
Using Induced Dipole Moment to Electrostatically Separate Healthy and Cancer Cell-Metal Nanoparticle Complex
![](/Images/Banner.png?raw=true)

## Synopsis

Our goal is to put together a sensor-pump system which would be able to adjust drug output of aminoglycosides based on real time sensing of drug in plasma. This would involve several stages, the first being the development of a functional sensor over the appropriate therapeutic range of concentrations. Similarly, a device will be designed which can attach to current hospital drip bags to control output and have configurable parameters for information such as normal drug clearance, volume of distribution, concentration of drug being delivered, and so on. The software to calculate the appropriate output will also be written.

## Software
Software will be needed to control the arduino uno unit that is controlling the potentiostat circuit and the feedback circuit to control the pump. Several supporting software such as a desktop GUI to display data from the potentiostat and simulations will also be written

## Hardware
### Electronics
The electronics part of this project includes the potentiostat and the DC Stepper Motor-Proximity Sensor component of the infusion pump.

### Microfluidic Chip
The microfluidic chip houses the aptamers immobilised on gold electrodes to sense drug levels. Currently we have only printed the electrodes onto glass slides. The next step will be to seal the two slides to form a channel for fluid to flow through. The stencil design can be found [here](/Hardware/Microfluidic%20Chip/electrode-template-v1.odt). Detailed instructions to be found [here](/Hardware/Microfluidic%20Chip/README.md).

## Installation, Maintenance and Testing Guide

### Potentiostat Interface Software
The interface uses the following software: python2, Tkinter, serial, io

### Potentiostat Dry Cell Test
1. Once you constructed the potentiostat circuit and connected it to the arduino according to the schematics, upload the potentiostat-controller sketch onto the arduino. 
2. Connect the Counter and Reference electrodes to one side of a 10kOhm resistor and the working electrode to the other side to complete the circuit.
3. Run the potentiostat interface software and connect to the appropriate device and run a sweep with default settings. The result should be something similar to the Potentiostat dry cell test with 10kOhm resistor shown above.

### Potentiostat Microfluidic Chip test with Phosphate Buffered Saline and Tobramycin solutions
The microfluidic chip and potentiostat probably do not work well together. Connect the device and software similar to the dry cell, but instead to the leads on the microfluidic chip.
