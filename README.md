# 32_The-Charge-on-Cancer
Using Induced Dipole Moment to Electrostatically Separate Healthy and Cancer Cell-Metal Nanoparticle Complex
![](/Images/Banner.png?raw=true)

## Synopsis

The current nanotechnology based strategies have introduced a number of nanoparticles of variable chemistry and architecture for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Most nanoparticles are designed to safely reach their target and specifically release their cargo at the site of the disease. But these cargos are usually coated with chemical drugs and most anticancer drugs do not kill cancer cells completely because the mechanism of cancer initiation and spread is not completely understood. Our proposed method based on physical techniques â€“ particularly the use of electric field to induce dipole moments - have a better chance at segregating, separating and killing cancer cells without causing damage to normal cells.

## Software
Software will be needed to control the arduino uno unit that is controlling the potentiostat circuit and the feedback circuit to control the pump. Several supporting software such as a desktop GUI to display data from the potentiostat and simulations will also be written

## Proposal
The proposal explores the use of electric fields to segregate cancer cells using conductive nanoparticles. The technology being explored consists of two parts: (i) The technique of embedding the nanoparticle with the cancer cells, and (ii) the technique to move the cancer call-nanoparticle complex.


## Hardware
Electrostatic Alignment of Metallic Particles:
If a dispersion of conductive metallic particles in an insulating fluid is contained in an environment bathed in an external electric field, the field polarizes the conductive particles allowing some of them to move and chain up due to dipole-dipole attractive forces. This phenomena is described in Fig. 1 and has been used for engineering applications such as self healing circuits. 
Therefore, electric fields can be used to move and cluster metallic particles.
